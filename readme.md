## üöÄ Project Overview

**The Backdooms** is a compressed, self-extracting and infinitely generating HTML game inspired by DOOM 1993 and The Backrooms that can be launched and played in a web browser directly from a QR code.

This project was a week-long study I performed (now slightly longer) designed to push the limits of QR code storage and compression, to demonstrate an innovative method of hosting lightweight web applications entirely within a QR code.

## üìú Features

‚úÖ **Fully Offline:** No internet connection is required to play the game after scanning the QR code. The URL basically has the ENTIRE code to the game

‚úÖ **Extreme Compression:** Utilizes a combination of Zlib compression with Gzip Decompression stream along with base64 encoding to make the final result extremely compressed.

‚úÖ **Self-Extracting Webpage:** Uses the `DecompressionStream` API to dynamically decompress and execute the game within the browser.

## üì¶ Installation & Dependencies

Well, technically speaking, just a modern web browser.

 But if we do get into the nitty gritty of generating a QR code of a ‚âà 2.5kb game:

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- `qrcode` library (for generating QR codes)
- `pillow` (for QR code image handling)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Convert Your Game to a QR Code
Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python3 QRGEN.py <your-game.html> <output-qrcode.png>
```
Example:
```bash
python3 QRGEN.py EVEN-SMALLER-SLAMMER-BACKROOMS.html qrcode.png
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Scan the QR Code
Use a smartphone or QR scanner to open the game directly in a web browser.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Play Instantly üéÆ
Enjoy *The Backdooms* without needing to download or install anything!

## üîç Technical Breakdown

### Compression Workflow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Read Input HTML] --> B[Compress with Zlib]
    B -->|wbits=15| C[Base64 Encode]
    C --> D[Embed in HTML Wrapper]
    
    subgraph browser[Browser Processing]
        D --> E[DecompressionStream 'gzip']
        E --> F{Format Mismatch}
    end
    
    F --> G[Convert to Data URI]
    G --> H{Fits QR Code?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Generate QR]
    H -->|No| J[Reduce HTML Size]
    J --> A
```    

**Read Input HTML:** The process starts by reading the given HTML content from a file or input source.

**Zlib Compression + GZip decompression:** The HTML is compressed using Zlib and uses Decompressionstream from GZip for best compression

**Base64 Encoding:** The compressed data is encoded in Base64, ensuring that it remains text-based and can be embedded in an HTML file safely.

**Embedding in HTML Wrapper:** A JavaScript-based self-extracting HTML wrapper is created. This wrapper includes a DecompressionStream API function that automatically decompresses the content when opened in a browser.

**Data URI Conversion:** The entire HTML is converted into a data:text/html;base64,... format, allowing it to be stored and shared easily without a physical file.

### QR Code Generation Logic

The system first tries to generate the smallest possible QR version using qr.make(fit=True), which dynamically adjusts the QR size based on content length.

If the required version exceeds 40 (the QR code standard limit), it forces version 40 with fit=False.

The lowest error correction level L (which allows the maximum data capacity) is used to fit as much data as possible.

If the data is still too large for QR v40 with level L, the process fails, and an error is returned.

### Outcome

If successful, a QR code is generated and displayed.

If not, the process terminates with an error message indicating that the data is too large to be encoded in a QR code.

This project is released under the **MIT License**‚Äîfree to use, modify, and share.
It would make me EXTREMELY happy to see other QR games or even seeing better versions of DOOM in a QR code, given there's so little resources related to this
